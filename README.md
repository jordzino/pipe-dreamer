Plumbing Hero: Pipe Dreamer! – README

Rapid Game Prototyping Coursework

Assigned Coursework Theme: 'Plumbing Hero'
 
Engine: Twine 

Game Overview:
Pipe Dreamer is a surreal, retro-inspired narrative adventure. You play Daniel, an exhausted plumber who enters a dream world of divine leaks, chrome sky-pipes, and mystical valve trials. Your choices determine whether Daniel wakes up… or ascends as the Pipe Dreamer.

The game features whimsical surrealism inspired by Mario and retro anime, gradually turning dark and weird as Daniel faces the growing pressure of the Flow.

Modifier (Retro Console): The game uses a limited color palette, and fantasy-console-style UI like the 'leak pressure meter'.

How to Play:
1. Open the`PipeDreamer.html` file in a web browser of your choice. Google Chrome is recommended.
2. Play through the story, and try different choices for alternate endings.

If I had more time:
I would have enabled the player to be able to collect items. I tried this initially, but I was not able to make it work with the remaining time that I had.
I also would have tried to recover the first draft of this prototype - I didn't understand how Twine worked regarding saving progress or accessing previous work across different devices.
